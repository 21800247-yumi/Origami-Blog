      <p>
        Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, a practice that transforms
        a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and
        sculpting techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word origami is derived from two words ori meaning folded and kami
        meaning paper. It was called Orikata previously which means folded
        shape.
