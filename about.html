        Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, a practice that transforms
        a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and
        sculpting techniques.

        The word origami is derived from two words ori meaning folded and kami
        meaning paper. It was called Orikata previously which means folded
        shape.
